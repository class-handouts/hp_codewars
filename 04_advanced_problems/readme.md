## Section 4 - Advanced Problems

This section houses problems that require critical thinking and problem solving
skills. There is not one person in the world that can solve these problems
without help or struggles. Please do not let my last sentence discouraged you,
as you work though these problems you will be improving you critical thinking
and problem solving skills.

Be sure first go over the programs in [teacher examples](./teacher_examples/readme.md). You will have to go to the [HP CodeWars](http://www.hpcodewars.org/) website to see the descriptions for most of these solutions. Finally, try the problems in [sample pratice problems ](sample_pratice_problems.md). Note that this file says sample practice problems that means you should work on other programs from past [HP CodeWars](http://www.hpcodewars.org/) events.
