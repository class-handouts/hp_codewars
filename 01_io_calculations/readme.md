## Section 1 - I/O and Calculations

This section focuses on problems where the amount of input are known before the program is run. These programs will require using all of the _primitive types_, _if/else_ statements, the _String_ class, the _DecimalFormat_ class, and the _Math_ class.

Be sure first to read all of the files in [review and notes](./review_and_notes/readme.md) then go over the programs in [teacher examples](./teacher_examples/readme.md). You will have to go to the [HP CodeWars](http://www.hpcodewars.org/) website to see the descriptions for some of these solutions. Finally, try the problems in [sample pratice problems](./sample_pratice_problems.md). Note that this file says sample practice problems that means you should work on other programs from past [HP CodeWars](http://www.hpcodewars.org/) events. [Here](./input_output.pdf) is a copy of the problems if their website is down.
