## Section 2 - Loops and Arrays
All of the programs in this section will require you to read in an unknown number of values. The input will be in one of two styles: the "first" line of the input is an integer value equal to the number of values you are reading; or you read in all of the values until you reach an "END FLAG". These problems will require everything from the last section plus _loops_ and _arrays_.

Be sure first to read all of the files in [review and notes](./review_and_notes/readme.md) then go over the programs in [teacher examples](./teacher_examples/readme.md). You will have to go to the [HP CodeWars](http://www.hpcodewars.org/) website to see the descriptions for most of these solutions. Finally, try the problems in [sample pratice problems](./sample_pratice_problems.md). Note that this file says sample practice problems that means you should work on other programs from past [HP CodeWars](http://www.hpcodewars.org/) events. [Here](./loops_and_arrays.pdf) is a copy of the problems if their website is down.
