## Section 3 - Intermediate Problems

Here you will find problems the require some combination of *multiple loops*,
*arrays* and/or *if/else* statements. The solution to these problems will need
you to use the **Guess**, **Try** and **Learn** technique. Keep in mind that we
are practicing these problems because we currently do not know how to solve
them.

Be sure first go over the programs in [teacher examples](./teacher_examples/readme.md). You will have to go to the [HP CodeWars](http://www.hpcodewars.org/) website to see the descriptions for most of these solutions. Finally, try the problems in [sample pratice problems](sample_pratice_problems.md). Note that this file says sample practice problems that means you should work on other programs from past [HP CodeWars](http://www.hpcodewars.org/) events.
