## HP CodeWars Guide

Welcome to my guide to help you prepare for the [HP CodeWars](http://www.hpcodewars.org/) competition. All of the problems that we will be focusing on are from the Roseville campus. Please note that very few of these problems prompt for user input, and most of the values are read in through standard input redirection. Please read [simple_example.pdf](simple_example.pdf) for an example.

This guide is organized into for sections:
1. [I/O & Calculations](./01_io_calculations/readme.md)
2. [Loops & Arrays](./02_loops_arrays/readme.md)
3. [Intermediate Problems](./03_intermediate_problems/readme.md)
4. [Advanced Problems](./04_advanced_problems/readme.md)
5. [Starter Code](./05_starter_code/readme.md)

Be sure the read the _readme.md_ file in each of these 4 sections for directions.
